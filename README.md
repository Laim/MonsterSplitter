.NET Windows Application that allows you to split large [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files down into smaller more managable chunks.  This application was created in 2019 for a very specific purpose and the code is capiable of being featured on /r/badcode.  It works, but it's not beautiful in anyway what so ever.
