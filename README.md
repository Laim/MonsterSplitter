**MonsterSplitter** is a .NET Windows Application that allows you to split large [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files down into smaller more managable chunks.

## Project Future
This application does basic file splitting,  I may add the planned features below in the future with some of them partially added already, but I currently have no plans to do so. 

## Planned Features
* Track Split Files
  - This will allow you to view the filename, size, date/time and the user who split the file.
* View Split Files in MonsterSplitter
